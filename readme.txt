* **Icon**: Display icons from a custom designed, curated list of over one hundred icons, with more icons being added in regular updates!
* **Icon Box**: Your standard icon box block on steroids. Choose from over one hundred custom designed icons, style them any way and at any size you like, add some text and you’re good to go.
* **Image Box**: A standard image box with title and text block on steroids. Adjust your spacing, layout, alignment, or colors and typography.
* **Image Comparison**: Need to showcase your photo editing skills or writing up a camera review? With the Image Comparison block you can enhance your posts with side-by-side comparison of any two photos you wish.
* **Justified Gallery**: Create beautiful justified grid layout galleries inside any of your post or pages.
* **Progress Bar**: Add stylish progress bars and display either progress or your skillset with the most visually captivating way.
