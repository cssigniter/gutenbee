GutenBee enhances the Gutenberg editor with more blocks!

== Description ==
GutenBee is a collection of elegant WordPress blocks enhancing your editing experience in the Gutenberg editor and vastly extending the potential of the new editor experience.

Check out [the demo](https://www.cssigniter.com/gutenbee/) now!

The plugin's documentation can be found [here](https://www.cssigniter.com/docs/gutenbee/).

**Blocks:**

* **Accordion**: Organize your content into accordion elements. All the content including titles can be edited directly in the WordPress editor and you can choose any color combination from the block’s settings.
* **Countdown**: Have an upcoming event? Pick a date directly inside the editor screen, choose your layout, colors, and typography and you’re ready!
* **CountUp**: Maybe not every block counts, but this one does! Pick a starting and ending number, add a suffix or prefix, style it and you’re done!
* **Divider**: Provide thematic content spacing with a fancy divider, edit its style, colors, and margins.
* **Google Maps**: Easy-peasy fancy maps with the Google Maps block. Just enter a location and save, it just works!
* **Icon**: Display icons from a custom designed, curated list of over one hundred icons, with more icons being added in regular updates!
* **Icon Box**: Your standard icon box block on steroids. Choose from over one hundred custom designed icons, style them any way and at any size you like, add some text and you’re good to go.
* **Image Box**: A standard image box with title and text block on steroids. Adjust your spacing, layout, alignment, or colors and typography.
* **Image Comparison**: Need to showcase your photo editing skills or writing up a camera review? With the Image Comparison block you can enhance your posts with side-by-side comparison of any two photos you wish.
* **Justified Gallery**: Create beautiful justified grid layout galleries inside any of your post or pages.
* **Progress Bar**: Add stylish progress bars and display either progress or your skillset with the most visually captivating way.
* **Slideshow**: Add a fancy slideshow to your posts or pages. Drag and drop your images, choose your settings and hit publish!
* **Tabs**: Organize your content into fancy tabs. All the content including titles can be edited directly in the WordPress editor and you can choose any color combination from the block’s settings.
