TODOS/IDEAS

- Style frontend slideshow
- Determine what we want for slide options and how to add them (button, link, title? will the title use the image caption or an indepdentant field)
- Should the editor slideshow look like it does on the front end?

Future advanced thoughts:
- Convert WP Gallery block into Slideshow (not sure if possible yet)?
- Convert Slideshow block into WP Gallery block?
